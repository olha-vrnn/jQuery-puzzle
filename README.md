# jQuery-puzzle
Creating puzzles using jQuery (draggable, droppable and sortable).

- Splitting an image into 16 equal parts and placing them in blocks is required.
- Clicking on the "Start game" button or dragging a puzzle to the right block should start the countdown timer. The button itself should be disabled.
- If the time runs out and you haven't solved the puzzle, a modal window should display the message "It's a pity, but you lost". The "Check result" button should be disabled.
- Clicking on the "Check result" button should display the message "You still have time, are you sure?" in a modal window with the remaining time.
- Clicking on the "Check result" button checks if the puzzle is solved correctly. If so, it displays the message "Woohoo, well done, you did it!" Otherwise, it displays "It's a pity, but you lost". The "Check result" button should be disabled.
- Clicking on the "Close" button closes the modal window.
- The "New game" button starts a new game.
